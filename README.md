# DynamicShortcuts
My goal with this project is to write a Windows service and GUI, which let's you set desktop icons that'll dynamically change. The idea is to port the, for mobile calendar apps common, behaviour of changing the icon according to the current date and weekday.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
